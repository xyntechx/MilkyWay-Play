## About
Milky Way is a game in which you, the player, are a pilot of a spaceship traversing our galaxy called Milky Way (hence the name)! Along the journey, you encounter another spaceship identical to yours in every way except for the colour. You find out that that spaceship is operated by an alien who wishes to destroy your spaceship and you along with it.

Survive by defeating the enemy and continue your adventure in Milky Way!

## How to Play
- Use the **arrow/WASD keys** to move around
- Press the **space bar** to shoot and thus damage the enemy
- Push the enemy around by bumping into it (just for fun!)
